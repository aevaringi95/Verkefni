```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
rm(list = ls())
setwd("~/Documents/Hagnýt Gagnagreining/FinalProject")
```


```{r}
data = read.csv("gagnasafn_ibudarhusnaedi.csv", header  = T, sep = ";")
```

We start by removing all the data which is not in the capital region. 

```{r}
capitalArea = c(0000,1000,1100,1300,1400,1604,1606)
data = data[data$svfn %in% capitalArea,]
```

Now we are going to remove the variables that we won't be using
```{r}
delete = names(data)[c(1,5,6,7,10,11,12,13,14,15,17,18,20,21,
                       25,26,38,40,41,42,44,47,50,52,53)]
data = data[,-which(names(data) %in% delete)]
```

```{r}
str(data)
```
